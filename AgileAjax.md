# Introduction #

AgileAjax is a package of javascript files that work independently and in conjunction with Prototype 1.6 or Ext 2.0.  AgileAjax is built with a design pattern to maximize flexibility.  Leveraging and enhancing the native XHR events it provides a much more stable and usable API.

  * Bundled in an ultra light framework to handle function closures, class inheritance and custom events.


  * Specialized versions for Prototype 1.6 and Ext 2.0.  Leading in less new code to incorporate to your project if you're using either framework.
